# MuseFrame Android App Deployment Guide

## üîÑ Version Bump

When releasing a new version, update the following files:

### 1. **app/build.gradle.kts**
Update both `versionCode` and `versionName`:
```kotlin
defaultConfig {
    applicationId = "com.museframe.app"
    minSdk = 24
    targetSdk = 36
    versionCode = 300100  // Increment this (e.g., 300101, 300102, etc.)
    versionName = "3.0.1" // Update semantic version (e.g., "3.0.2", "3.1.0", etc.)
    ...
}
```

**Version Code Rules:**
- Must be incremented for each release
- Currently using format: Major(3) + Minor(00) + Patch(100) = 300100
- Example: 3.0.2 ‚Üí 300200, 3.1.0 ‚Üí 301000
- Must be higher than any previously installed version

## üåê API Endpoint Changes

### 1. **app/src/main/java/com/museframe/app/data/api/ApiConstants.kt**
```kotlin
object ApiConstants {
    const val BASE_URL = "https://api.museframe.com/"  // Change this URL
    const val CONNECT_TIMEOUT = 30L
    const val READ_TIMEOUT = 30L
    const val WRITE_TIMEOUT = 30L
}
```

### 2. **Backend URLs in Code**
If you have any hardcoded URLs, search and update in:
- `app/src/main/java/com/museframe/app/data/api/MuseFrameApiService.kt`
- Any repository implementations that might have endpoint overrides

## üî® Building Release APK

### Prerequisites
1. **Keystore file**: Already configured at `app/muse-tv.jks`
2. **Signing config**: Already set in `app/build.gradle.kts`

### Build Steps

#### Option 1: Command Line
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/seanliang/AndroidStudioProjects/MuseFrame

# Clean previous builds (optional but recommended)
./gradlew clean

# Build release APK
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

#### Option 2: Android Studio
1. Open Android Studio
2. Select `Build` ‚Üí `Generate Signed Bundle / APK...`
3. Choose `APK`
4. Select `release` build variant
5. Click `Build`

### Output Location
The signed APK will be generated at:
```
app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

## üì± Installation

### Local Installation via ADB
```bash
# Connect your Android TV/device
adb devices

# Install the APK
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk

# Or reinstall (if app already exists)
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

### Manual Installation
1. Copy the APK to your device via USB or network
2. Use a file manager on the device to install
3. Enable "Unknown Sources" in device settings if needed

## üìã Pre-Release Checklist

Before building a release:

- [ ] Update version code and name in `build.gradle.kts`
- [ ] Verify API endpoint in `ApiConstants.kt`
- [ ] Test on debug build first
- [ ] Check that all features work with production API
- [ ] Verify push notifications are working
- [ ] Test on actual Android TV device
- [ ] Clean and rebuild project

---

## üöÄ Quick Release Commands

```bash
# Complete release build sequence
cd /Users/seanliang/AndroidStudioProjects/MuseFrame
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleRelease

# Install on connected device
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

---

## üîë Keystore Information

**Location**: `app/muse-tv.jks`
**Key Alias**: `key0`
**Store Password**: `lZVrMpQzyVtxBA7AZ`
**Key Password**: `lZVrMpQzyVtxBA7AZ`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Keep these credentials secure and never commit them to version control!

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Build Failures
```bash
# Clear build cache
./gradlew clean
rm -rf .gradle
rm -rf app/build

# Rebuild
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

### Signing Issues
- Verify keystore file exists at `app/muse-tv.jks`
- Check passwords in `build.gradle.kts` match the keystore
- Ensure keystore hasn't expired

### Installation Issues

#### Signature Mismatch (Expo vs Native)
When switching between Expo and native Android builds:

```bash
# Error: INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE
# This happens when Expo version and native version have different signatures

# Solution 1: Build RELEASE APK instead of debug
./gradlew assembleRelease
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk

# Solution 2: Uninstall existing version first
adb uninstall com.museframe.app
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/[debug|release]/app-[debug|release].apk
```

**Important Notes:**
- Debug builds use different signatures (Expo debug key vs Android Studio debug key)
- Release builds use your `muse-tv.jks` keystore - same for both Expo and native
- Always use **release builds** for testing when you have Expo version installed
- Version code must be higher than existing installation

#### General Installation Issues
```bash
# Check connected devices
adb devices

# Force reinstall (overwrites existing)
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk

# If still fails, uninstall first
adb uninstall com.museframe.app
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```
